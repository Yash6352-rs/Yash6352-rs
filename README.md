## 📈 Projects
Here are a few areas I'm currently exploring or have built projects in:

### 🧠 MindMapper.AI
- A full-stack web app for creating and managing mind maps.
- Built with React (Vite) on the frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and MongoDB Atlas for storage.
- Integrated with AI (via OpenRouter) to suggest nodes/ideas.
- Focus: Productivity, visualization, and AI-assisted brainstorming.

### 🤖 GenAI Project:
- Medical Chatbot (LLM-based) – Developed an intelligent chatbot capable of answering questions related to diseases, symptoms, and medicines using Meta’s LLaMA large language model. Integrated it with a         conversational interface for real-time medical Q&A, simulating a virtual health assistant.

### 🤖 ML Projects:
As part of my ongoing AI/ML training, I developed a series of end-to-end machine learning projects focused on real-world problem-solving, applying data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment     techniques using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.
- 📊 BMI Prediction – Built a regression model to estimate Body Mass Index using lifestyle and health-related data.
- ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction – Created a classification model to predict whether a flight will be delayed using historical flight data.
- 💰 Loan Eligibility Prediction – Designed a model to evaluate loan approval chances based on applicant credit and financial details.

### 🧠 DL Projects:
As part of exploring deep learning and neural networks, I’ve started building intelligent systems that combine NLP and DL models using Python, PyTorch, NLTK, Flask.
- 🤖 AI Assistant (Chatbot) – Built a personalized AI chatbot using PyTorch, NLTK, and Flask. It can respond to user queries, open websites/apps, check time/date, and even search files on the system.
- 📝 Sketch-to-Emoji Converter (Upcoming) – Will develop a DL-based app that converts user sketches to emojis using ANN and CNN models.
- 🔄 More DL/NLP Projects Coming Soon! – Continuously expanding my portfolio with real-world deep learning applications.

### 🌐 Frontend (React) Project:
When learning React.js build a TextUtils App – a React-based utility app for basic text manipulation. Users can:
- Convert text to uppercase/lowercase
- Copy text
- Clear text
- Remove extra spaces
- Toggle between dark mode and light mode for better UI experience

### 🖥️ Days when learning javascript made a Website GameHub having 2 mini games.
- Tic Tac toe and Rock Paper Scissors....and will add more in future
- Also made a clone of Amazon website
